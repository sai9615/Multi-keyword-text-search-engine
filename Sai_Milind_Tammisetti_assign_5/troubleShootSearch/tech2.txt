You never really understand a person until you consider things from his point of views
We accept the love we think we deserve
There is no greater agony than bearing an untold story inside you
It grows from the relationships we create between each other and the world, and still it is never complete
As he read, I fell in love the way you fall asleep
Nothing in life is as important as you think it is, while you are thinking about it
Open your eyes and see what you can with them before they close forever
